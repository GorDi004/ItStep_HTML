    <h3>Mathematical formulas</h3>
    <p><b>Linear Equations</b></p>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <div class="formula">
        <p>ax + b = 0</p>
    </div>
    <p>where <span>a</span> and <span>b</span> are real numbers and <span>x</span> is a variable. This form
    is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. Note that most linear equations will 
    not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <span>&#10008;</span>
    so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span>&#10008;</span> there.</p>
    <p><b>Quadric Equation</b></p>
    <p>The standard form of a quadric equation looks like this:</p>
    <div class="formula">
        <p>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
    </div>
